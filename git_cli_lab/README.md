# Unit 0: Lab - Making Your First Pull Request
The purpose of this lab is to pull together everything that we have learned about git, GitHub, and the Command Line Interface. In your very first lab of the school year, I will ask you to...
  * Fork and clone a repo
  * Navigate your directores using the command line
  * Create your first Markdown file
  * Stage and commit changes
  * Push changes to your remote repo
  * **Make your first pull request**

In order to avoid frustration and confusion, follow this guide step-by-step and reach out to your community when you need help. Do not be afraid of "breaking" anything. You can always delete the directory and start all over again!

Okay, here we go!

1. Fork the [git_cli_lab repo](https://github.com/The-Marcy-Lab-School/se-unit-0/tree/master/lesson_1_git/git_cli_lab)
2. Clone the repository, creating a copy on your local environment.
3. In your local environment, navigate to your newly added `git_cli_lab/` directory.
4. Inside of the `git_cli_lab/` directory, create a new Markdown file for your blog post. Use the following _naming convention_: `FIRSTNAME_LASTNAME_blog0.md`
5. Open the newly created Markdown file and copy your pre-work blog post into the file, being sure to use Markdown syntax for headings, lists, bold, italics, etc. When you are done, save and close the file.
6. Stage your changes using `git add [filename]`
7. Commit your changes using `git commit -m "[Enter commit message here]"`
8. Push your changes back up to the remote copy of _your fork_. `git push origin master`
9. Log back on to GitHub.com.
10. Navigate back to your fork of the `git_cli_lab` repository. 
11. Open a **pull request**. ![pull request photo](./pull_request.png) 
    ...then click ![pull request photo 2](./pull_request2.png)
    ...and lastly ![pull request photo 3](./pull_request3.png)
12. And just like that... you're done! You've made your first pull request!
